# Stats_for_Machine_Learning

Statistics isn't just about numbers; it's the language that machines understand to unveil insights and make predictions. It's the compass guiding us through the intricacy of data, helping us make informed decisions. Let's embark on a quest to understand its key terms and unravel its significance.

### Key Statistical Terms in Machine Learning:
- Mean: The average value, providing a central measure.
- Variance: The spread or dispersion of data points.
- Standard Deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion.
- Skewness: Indicates the asymmetry of a distribution.
- IQR (Interquartile Range): The range between the first and third quartiles, helping identify outliers.

### In the dataset at our disposal, we encounter different types of variables, each with its unique role:

- Categorical Variables: Manufacturer Type, Vehicle Type.
- Numerical Variables: Sales in Thousands, Year Resale Value, Price in Thousands, Engine Size, Horsepower.
